# (Differentially) Private Synthetic Data Workshop 
Cardiff University, December 11th 2019,  [Bute Building S/2.32](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir//51.486654,-3.182173/@51.4867517,-3.1796604,17z)


## Call
We live in a society that is collecting data at an unprecedented level and very often this data is sensitive. Scientific studies often use confidential data. Government agencies hold data about citizens that are equally sensitive. And companies - think Facebook, Google or Twitter - are amassing data about consumer (online) behavior.

The original microdata can usually not be shared due to privacy concerns. Yet access for researchers to such data could potentially lead to new discoveries.  Statistical agencies might even be obliged to publish data without harming the privacy of individuals in the original collection.

One idea that recent research has increasingly focussed on is generating synthetic data. Ideally, synthetic microdata allows researchers to draw similar inferences as with the original data while protecting privacy. First promising research on synthesising microdata under strict privacy definitions - e.g. under differential privacy - has been published.

However, the debates often remain within their respective academic disciplines. This workshop intends to bring together leading researchers on privacy preserving synthetic data from computer sciences, statistics and applied backgrounds such as social sciences. Spotlighting recent advances in the respective disciplines, we especially seek to facilitate an interdisciplinary debate. Our goal is to share best practices and insights, identify joint challenges, and sketch the foundation for a joint roadmap.

Open questions include:
- How to measure disclosure risk with synthetic data?
- How to measure the utility of synthetic data for yet unknown analyses?
- How to account for the errors introduced by the privacy protection mechanism in subsequent analyses?
- What is an intuitive measure of privacy protection for applied researchers?

## Logistics
* Registration is open in entry hall of Bute building from 9am.
* The workshop starts at 10am and ends at 6pm.
* Every presentation can take up to 15 mins.
* Each block consists of a set of presentations and 30 mins joint discussions/questions.
* After each block, there is a 45 mins break to chat and have a coffee/tea/sandwich in an informal setting.
* The last hour is an open space format to enable further collaborations.
* For those who want to continue, we will have dinner at [Valentino's](https://www.valentinocardiff.com/) at 7pm. Please confirm your participation with [Chris](mailto:arnoldc6@cardiff.ac.uk) until December 5th.
* We will provide you with a quick 4 item questionnaire after the workshop. Chris and George will use it to collect joint learnings, edit responses and feed everything back.
